# jsonplaceholdertestsuite
API Test Suite for jsonplaceholder.com posts and comments endpoints

While this is not nearly the number of tests that a real test suite would have, this is a representative sample of what could be done to test an endpoint.

Project and dependencies are built with Maven
Test framework done with TestNG
API connections done with REST Assured library
JSON parsing done with org.json library
